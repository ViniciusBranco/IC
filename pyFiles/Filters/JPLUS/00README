Theoretical definition of the J-PLUS Filter System
==================================================

Version: 17-01-2013

This directory contains the specified transmission curves of the
J-PLUS Filter System.

Description of the files:

- 00REAME ---> This file
- J-PLUS_FiltersRequirements.tab ---> Table with the theoretical
               requirements of the filters.
- PM_001_PEPSI_03.dat ---> Expected transmission curve of the 
      T80Cam-North CCD.
- *_with_ccd_qe.dat ---> Transmission curves of the filters,
               constructed from the theoretical requirements.
               Two values of transmission are provided: Transmission
               of the filters, and combined transmission of filters
               and ccd.
- J-PLUS_Filter_System_and_CCD_QE.pdf ---> Plot of the theoretical
               transmission curve of the J-PLUS filters and the 
               T80Cam-North quantum efficiency.
- J-PLUS_Filter_System_Convolved_with_CCD_QE.pdf ---> Plot of the
               expected combined transmissions of J-PLUS Filters and 
               T80Cam North CCD.
